• A discrete element method based particle simulator that is capable of modeling large scale three-dimensional packings of spherical and non-spherical (regular and irregular) particles.
• The simulator can generate random, fining upward, and coarsening upward loose and dense packings. 
• Porosity and coordination number characterization of the generated packings conforms to previous studies, both theoretical and experimental.
